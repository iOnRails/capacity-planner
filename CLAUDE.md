# Capacity Planner — Project Documentation

## Overview

A web-based capacity planning tool for managing engineering team workload across verticals (Growth, Sportsbook, Casino, Account, Payments). Projects are sized in T-shirt sizes, allocated to swimlane tracks (Core Bonus, Gateway, SEO & AFF), and visualized on a drag-and-drop roadmap with a timeline/Gantt view.

**Tech Stack**: Single-file React SPA (no build system) + Express.js API + JSON file storage
**Auth**: Google Sign-In restricted to @novibet.com
**Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Railway (API + persistent volume at `/data`)

### WebSocket
- Path: `/ws`
- Client sends: `{ "type": "subscribe", "vertical": "growth" }`
- Server broadcasts full state on save: `{ "type": "update", "vertical": "growth", "updatedAt": "...", "senderId": "abc123", "state": {...}, "projects": [...] }`
- Inline state avoids clients needing an HTTP fetch after WS notification (fixes background-tab throttling)
- Each client has unique `wsIdRef` sent as `X-WS-ID` header to skip own broadcasts
- **Keepalive pings**: Server sends `{ "type": "ping" }` every 25s to prevent proxy idle timeouts; clients respond with `pong`

---

## Conflict Resolution

The server uses **field-level timestamps** (`_fieldTs`) for optimistic concurrency:

1. Client sends `_loadedAt` (timestamp when it last fetched state) + only changed fields
2. For each field:
   - If `fieldTs[field] <= _loadedAt` → **Accept** (no conflict)
   - If conflict on **object field** (tracks, trackBlockOrder, etc.) → **Sub-key merge**: accept client's changed sub-keys, keep server's for the rest
   - If conflict on **primitive/array field** → **Reject**, keep server's version
3. Only bumps `fieldTs[field]` when value actually changes (prevents no-op false conflicts)
4. Returns `{ mergedState, conflicts: [rejected field names] }`

### Client-Side Deep Merge
Before sending, the client does sub-key level merging for object fields:
- Captures `serverSnapshotRef` at change time
- On save, compares local state against captured snapshot to find user-changed sub-keys
- Reads LATEST `serverSnapshotRef` as the merge base
- Overlays only user-changed sub-keys on top of latest server state
- This preserves other users' changes to different sub-keys within the same field

### Snapshot Consistency
The `serverSnapshotRef` stores **migrated/defaulted** values (matching what React state actually holds), not raw server responses. This prevents false "changed" detection from migration artifacts (e.g., `migrateTracks` adding missing track keys).

## Frontend Features

### Planner View (main view)
- **Roadmap Lane**: 3 swimlane tracks (Core Bonus, Gateway, SEO & AFF) with drag-and-drop project blocks
- **Backlog Lane**: Unallocated projects
- **Block sizing**: Width proportional to total sprints (min 100px, max 360px)
- **Overflow detection**: Red badge when a project pushes track capacity over allocation
- **Ghost blocks**: Dashed blocks showing split allocations from other tracks
- **Drag reordering**: Reorder blocks within a track (persisted as `trackBlockOrder`)
- **Drag between tracks**: Move projects between swimlanes or to/from backlog
- **Capacity bars**: Per-discipline utilization percentage per track

### Configuration Panel (collapsible tabs)
- **Configuration**: Team capacity per discipline + T-shirt size mapping
- **Swimlane Allocation**: Per-track capacity allocation with validation (can't exceed total)
- **Demand & Buffer**: Total demand view + buffer percentage adjustments
- **Capacity Usage**: Visual bars for all disciplines + total

### Timeline / Gantt View (modal)
- **Ruler**: Weeks, months, or quarters scale
- **Project bars**: Positioned and sized based on sprints, draggable
- **Resize handles**: Left/right handles to adjust start/duration
- **Lane assignment**: Drag vertically to assign sub-lanes
- **Sub-lanes**: Add/remove parallel lanes per track
- **Milestones**: Vertical lines with flags, CRUD operations
- **Auto-layout**: Default positioning based on sprint count, overridable

### Project Settings Modal (⚙)
- **Tabbed interface**: Gear icon (`⚙`) on track blocks and ghost blocks opens a tabbed modal
- **General tab**: Set project status (Not Started / In Progress / Paused) + percentage complete (0-100%)
- **Split tab**: Allocate partial project work to other tracks (hidden for ghost blocks since they are already splits)
- **Ghost block independence**: Ghost (split) blocks have their own status and progress, completely independent from the parent project. Stored in `splitStatuses` state field.
- **Status visuals** applied across all views (roadmap, timeline, quarterly):
  - **Not Started**: Default appearance, no special styling
  - **In Progress**: Green inset border + purple progress bar below the block
  - **Paused**: Desaturated (`filter: saturate(0.3)`) + diagonal stripe overlay + yellow/amber border + pause icon (⏸) overlay + yellow progress bar
  - **Overflow**: Badge only (`⚠ BE·FE`) showing which disciplines exceed capacity — no red border
- **Progress bar**: 5-6px bar at the bottom of each block, purple fill (`var(--accent)`) for in-progress, yellow for paused, fills proportionally to the block's width based on % complete
- **Backward compatible**: Projects without `status` field derive it from `inProgress` boolean

### Projects Table View
- **Editable grid**: Click to edit any cell inline
- **Bulk operations**: Multi-select + bulk field edit/delete
- **Excel import**: .xlsx/.xls/.csv with flexible column mapping (case-insensitive, matches by epic+subTask)
- **Search**: Filters by subTask, nvrd, masterEpic
- **Filter dropdowns**: Pillar, Epic, Market, KPI, Impact (multi-select)
- **Sorting**: Impact (desc), Effort (desc), Name, Epic, Pillar
- **Add/Delete**: Individual project management

### Undo/Redo
- **History stack**: `useRef`-based undo/redo stacks (max 50 entries)
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `Ctrl+Z` (undo), `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` (redo)
- **Header buttons**: Undo/Redo buttons with disabled state when stack is empty
- **Skip capture**: `skipUndoRef` prevents capturing state during undo/redo operations
- **Auto-save**: Undo/redo triggers a debounced save to persist the restored state
- Wraps `setVerticalStates` via `setVerticalStatesWithUndo` to capture state before every mutation

### Dashboard View
- **Summary cards**: Total Projects, In Roadmap, In Progress, In Backlog counts
- **Capacity Utilization**: Per-discipline bars showing used vs available sprints
- **Demand vs Supply**: Side-by-side comparison with buffered values
- **Per-Track Breakdown**: Table with allocated/used/remaining per track per discipline
- **Projects by Pillar**: Horizontal bar chart
- **Projects by Impact Size**: Bar chart (XS through XXXL)
- **Size Map Reference**: Grid showing current T-shirt size → sprint mappings
- Accessible via "Dashboard" tab in the header

### Masterplan + Workspaces
The **Masterplan** is the permanent, non-deletable live roadmap per vertical (stored in `state_{vertical}.json` / `projects_{vertical}.json`). **Snapshots** are editable workspace copies.

- **Workspace switching**: Each user independently works on Masterplan or a snapshot workspace
- **Auto-save routing**: `saveState`/`saveProjects` route to snapshot PUT endpoint when on a workspace; all ~40 `debouncedSave` call sites work unchanged
- **WS/poll guards**: Masterplan sync (WS, poll, visibility) is skipped when on a snapshot workspace
- **Promote**: Copy snapshot state+projects to overwrite the Masterplan, broadcasts to all users
- **Create from snapshot**: `sourceSnapshotId` parameter branches a new snapshot from an existing one
- **Header indicator**: Green "Masterplan" label or blue snapshot name + "Back to Masterplan" + "Promote" buttons
- **Modal UI**: "Workspaces" button in header → modal with Masterplan shown first (non-deletable), snapshots with "Open" action
- Stored server-side as `snapshots_{vertical}.json`

### ExCo Permission Layer & Sign-Off Versioning
- **ExCo list**: Admin manages ExCo members via admin panel; stored in `exco.json`
- **Sign-off**: ExCo members (or admin) can sign off the Masterplan quarterly view, creating a versioned snapshot in `signoffs_{vertical}.json`
- **Diff dropdown**: Quarterly modal header has a dropdown listing all sign-off versions (label + signer email + date); selecting one enables diff mode
- **Diff view**: NEW/MOVED/REMOVED badges on quarterly blocks comparing current Masterplan against selected sign-off version
- **Delete sign-offs**: Admin can delete old sign-off versions via a red trash button in the quarterly header
- **Editor access**: Editors are managed per-vertical; non-editors get read-only access; users can request access

### Quarterly View (modal)
- **Gantt-style blocks**: Projects positioned by `leftPct`/`widthPct` across quarters
- **Swimlane tracks**: Same 3 tracks as roadmap, each with sub-lanes
- **Sign-off button**: Only visible when on Masterplan and user is ExCo
- **Diff overlay**: Ghost blocks from signed-off version with comparison badges

### Auth
- Google Sign-In with @novibet.com domain restriction
- JWT decode (no server-side verification)
- Auto-refresh on expiration
- Audit log link visible only for specific admin email

### Real-time Sync
- **WebSocket**: Full-state broadcast — server sends state + projects inline with WS messages
- **Keepalive pings**: Server pings every 25s, client responds with pong (prevents proxy idle disconnect)
- **Deferred sync**: If a WS/poll notification arrives during an in-flight save, sync runs after save completes
- **Cancel pending save**: When server has newer data, pending local debounced saves are cancelled
- **Fallback poll**: 30-second interval lightweight poll endpoint
- **Visibility change**: Immediate sync when tab becomes visible
- **Debounced saves**: 800ms debounce, captures state at change time
- **Beacon API**: Flushes pending saves on page unload

## Verticals & Tracks

**5 Verticals**: Growth, Sportsbook, Casino, Account, Payments
**3 Tracks per vertical**: Core Bonus (yellow), Gateway (pink), SEO & AFF (green)
**4 Disciplines**: Backend, Frontend, Natives, QA

Each vertical has independent projects, state, and capacity configuration.

## Key Implementation Notes

### Single-File Architecture
The entire frontend is in `index.html` — no build system, no bundler. React and Babel are loaded from CDN. This means:
- All components are in one file (search by function name)
- State management is via React hooks (useState, useRef, useCallback, useMemo)
- No module imports — everything is in global scope or closure

### Data Persistence
- JSON files on Railway's persistent volume (`DATA_DIR=/data`)
- No database — reads/writes are synchronous `fs.readFileSync`/`fs.writeFileSync`
- File naming: `projects_{vertical}.json`, `state_{vertical}.json`, `snapshots_{vertical}.json`, `signoffs_{vertical}.json`, `exco.json`, `editors.json`, `audit_log.json`

### Migration Functions
- `migrateTracks()`: Renames legacy 'gamification' → 'gateway', ensures all 3 track keys exist
- `migrateTrackCapacity()`: Ensures all 3 track keys exist with zero defaults

### Known Issues / In Progress
- **Multi-tab sync**: WebSocket notifications work but the underlying conflict resolution for simultaneous edits to the same object field (e.g., two users reordering different tracks within `trackBlockOrder`) can still lose changes in edge cases. The sub-key merge on both client and server handles most cases but rapid concurrent edits to the same field remain challenging.
- **Console logging**: Debug logs (`[ws]`, `[sync]`, `[save]`, `[deepMerge]`, `[merge]`) are still present for diagnostics

## Environment Variables (Railway)

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `PORT` | 3000 (default) | Server port |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | `*` | Allowed origins |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Persistent volume path |

---

## Audit System

All state and project changes are logged to `audit_log.json` with:
- User email and name (from Google auth headers)
- **Rich narrative descriptions**: Human-readable diffs with project name resolution (e.g., "Moved [Marketplace] CY Expansion to Core Bonus", "Changed Backend capacity from 40 to 46 SP")
- **Structured diffs**: `{ summary, diffs[] }` format — summary has first 2 narratives + "and N more", diffs array has all individual change narratives
- Helper functions: `buildNarratives()` (per-field narrative generation), `findMovedItem()` (detects reorders in arrays), `summarizeValue()` (truncates long objects)
- Vertical, method, endpoint
- Auto-pruned after 30 days
- Queryable via `GET /api/audit-log?user=&vertical=&days=`
- Standalone viewer at `audit.html`

## Testing

- **340+ tests** across 7 test files in `api/__tests__/`
- `computations.test.js` (131+ tests) — Shared pure functions (sizeToSprints, projectSprints, effectiveSprints, deepMerge, migration, capacity, overflow, filter/sort, getProjectStatus, getPercentComplete, getSplitStatus, getSplitPercentComplete)
- `helpers.test.js` (62 tests) — loadJSON, saveJSON, buildNarratives, findMovedItem, summarizeValue, describeStateChanges, logAudit
- `api.test.js` (62+ tests) — All REST endpoints, validation, conflict resolution (incl. mixed accept/reject, force overwrite, status/percentComplete validation)
- `sanitization.test.js` (30 tests) — Input sanitization and XSS prevention
- `snapshots.test.js` (23 tests) — Snapshot CRUD, workspace GET/PUT, promote, sourceSnapshotId, audit logging
- `exco-signoff.test.js` (21 tests) — ExCo CRUD, sign-off creation/listing/retrieval, admin-only sign-off deletion
- `websocket.test.js` (11 tests) — WS subscribe, broadcast, sender exclusion, multi-client, disconnect
- Run: `npm test` (or `npm run test:unit`, `test:integration`, `test:ws`, `test:snapshots`, `test:computations`)
- `require.main === module` guard on server allows test imports without starting the listener
