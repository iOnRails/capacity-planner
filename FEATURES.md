## Architecture

The app is a single-page React 18 application (`index.html`) with Babel standalone transpilation (no build step), backed by an Express.js API (`api/server.js`) with WebSocket real-time sync. Data is persisted as JSON files on the server.

| Layer | Technology | File(s) |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Frontend | React 18 + Babel standalone (CDN) | `index.html` |
| Audit Log Viewer | React 18 + Babel standalone | `audit.html` |
| API | Express.js + WebSocket (ws) | `api/server.js` |
| Data Storage | JSON files on disk | `api/data/*.json` |
| Auth | Google OAuth (domain-restricted) | Embedded in `index.html` |
| Hosting | Vercel (frontend) + Railway (API) | `vercel.json` |

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Vertical Support

The planner supports 5 independent product verticals, each with its own projects, state, and capacity settings: **Growth**, **Sportsbook**, **Casino**, **Account**, and **Payments**.

- Vertical selector in the header allows switching between verticals
- Each vertical has independent projects, state, and configuration
- Data files: `projects_{vertical}.json` and `state_{vertical}.json`
- API routes are namespaced: `/api/verticals/:key/...`

### 2. Project Management

Projects are the core data entity. Each project has metadata fields and size estimations per discipline.

**Project Fields:**
- `id` (required) — unique identifier
- `nvrd` — external reference ID (e.g., JIRA)
- `masterEpic` — parent epic grouping
- `subTask` — project name/description
- `pillar` — strategic pillar (Expansion, Acquisition, Comms, Core Platform, Gamification, Core Bonus)
- `targetMarket` — target market (GR, BR, CY, MX, Global)
- `targetKPI` — target metric (Revenue, Experience, Efficiency)
- `impact` — estimated impact size (XS to XXXL)
- `backend`, `frontend`, `natives`, `qa` — discipline size estimates (XS to XXXL)
- `inProgress` — whether work has started

**Validation:** Size fields accept only: empty, XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL.

**Files:** `api/server.js` (saveProjectsHandler, lines 601-653), `index.html` (project editing components)

### 3. Capacity Management

Team capacity is configured per discipline (Backend, Frontend, Natives, QA) as story points. Capacity can be set at the global level and overridden per swimlane track.

- **Global capacity:** Total SP available per discipline per sprint
- **Track capacity:** Optional per-track overrides (e.g., Gateway Backend gets 15 SP)
- **Buffer:** Additional buffer SP per discipline to account for unplanned work
- **Size map:** Configurable mapping from t-shirt sizes to story points (e.g., M = 8 SP)

**State fields:** `capacity`, `trackCapacity`, `buffer`, `sizeMap`

### 4. Swimlane Tracks (Roadmap)

Projects are organized into 3 swimlane tracks for the roadmap view: **Core Bonus**, **Gateway**, and **SEO & Affiliates**.

- Projects can be dragged between tracks and within tracks to reorder
- Each track shows its assigned projects as blocks with color-coded discipline bars
- Track capacity bars show used vs. available capacity per discipline
- Unallocated and overflow indicators per track

**State fields:** `tracks` (project ID assignments), `trackBlockOrder` (display ordering)

### 5. Drag-and-Drop Ordering

Blocks within each swimlane track can be reordered via drag-and-drop.

- Supports dragging regular project blocks and ghost/split blocks
- Can drag to start, end, or between existing blocks
- Block order is persisted per track in `trackBlockOrder`
- Ghost blocks (split portions) use the `ghost:{projectId}` key format

**State field:** `trackBlockOrder`

### 6. Project Splits

A project can be "split" across two swimlane tracks. When split, a portion of its story points is allocated to a target track while the remainder stays in the original track.

- Split configuration: target track + SP allocation per discipline
- Creates a "ghost block" in the target track representing the split portion
- Ghost blocks appear in the ordering as `ghost:{projectId}`
- Split can be created, modified, or removed

**State field:** `splits` — `{ projectId: { targetTrack, backend, frontend, natives, qa } }`

### 7. Timeline View

A Gantt-style timeline showing project bars positioned across sprints/weeks.

- Configurable total weeks and sprint duration
- Project bars can be dragged to adjust start/end positions
- Timeline overrides allow manual positioning of bars
- Lane assignments control which row each project appears in
- Sub-lane counts allow multiple rows per track

**State fields:** `timelineConfig`, `timelineOverrides`, `timelineLaneAssignments`, `trackSubLaneCounts`

### 8. Milestones

Named markers on the timeline at specific week positions with configurable colors.

- Add/remove milestones with label, week number, and color
- Displayed as vertical lines on the timeline view

**State field:** `milestones` — `[{ label, week, color }]`

### 9. Google OAuth Authentication

Domain-restricted authentication via Google Sign-In.

- Allowed domain: `novibet.com`
- Admin email: `kmermigkas@novibet.com`
- Google Client ID: `487456084105-01l0m47e7up61qb40sf2v7gtjmrp6hqt.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- Auth stored in localStorage (`cp_google_auth`)
- User email and name sent to API via `X-User-Email` and `X-User-Name` headers

**File:** `index.html` (AuthGate component)

### 10. Real-Time WebSocket Sync

Multi-tab and multi-user real-time sync using WebSocket with full-state broadcasting.

- Clients subscribe to a vertical: `{ type: 'subscribe', vertical: '...' }`
- On state/project save, server broadcasts full state + projects to all subscribed clients
- Broadcast includes `senderId` (from `X-WS-ID` header) so the originating tab can skip its own update
- Keepalive pings every 25 seconds prevent Railway/proxy from closing idle connections
- Welcome message `{ type: 'connected' }` sent on connection

**Server:** `api/server.js` (WebSocketServer, broadcastUpdate, keepalive interval)
**Client:** `index.html` (WebSocket connection management, auto-reconnect)

### 11. Conflict-Free State Merge

The state save system uses a field-level timestamp-based merge strategy to handle concurrent edits.

**How it works:**
1. Client loads state and receives `_loadedAt` timestamp
2. Client sends changed fields with `_loadedAt` when saving
3. Server checks per-field timestamps (`_fieldTs`) against client's `_loadedAt`
4. If field wasn't modified since client loaded → accept client's value
5. If conflict on object field → sub-key merge (client deletions respected, unchanged server keys preserved)
6. If conflict on non-object field (array, primitive) → reject, keep server value
7. No-op saves (identical value) don't bump field timestamps, preventing false conflicts

**Returns:** `{ success, mergedState, conflicts: [...rejected field names] }`

**File:** `api/server.js` (saveStateHandler, lines 496-595)

### 12. Fallback Polling

When WebSocket is unavailable or as a backup, clients poll the server for changes.

- Polls `/api/verticals/:key/poll` every 30 seconds
- Lightweight endpoint returns only `updatedAt` timestamp and project count (no full state)
- Full state fetch only triggered if `updatedAt` has changed
- Disabled while dragging or saving to avoid conflicts

**File:** `index.html` (polling logic), `api/server.js` (poll endpoint)

### 13. Human-Readable Audit Log

Every state and project change is logged with narrative descriptions.

**Narrative format:** Each change produces `{ text, icon }` objects with natural language descriptions.

**Icon categories:**
| Icon | Symbol | Color | Meaning |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| move | ↔ | Blue | Item moved/reordered |
| plus | + | Green | Item added |
| minus | − | Red | Item removed |
| pencil | ✎ | Yellow | Item modified |
| split | ⑂ | Purple | Project split created |
| arrow-up | ↑ | Green | Value increased |
| arrow-down | ↓ | Red | Value decreased |

**Example narratives:**
- `Moved "SEO Cache Tool Enhancements" to position 2`
- `Changed Backend capacity from 32 to 46 SP`
- `Split "Casino Widget" to Gateway with 4 Backend, 2 Frontend`
- `Added milestone "Sprint Review" at week 4`
- `Changed Gateway sub-lanes from 1 to 3`

**Features:**
- 30-day retention with automatic pruning
- Filterable by user, vertical, and time range
- Expandable entries show detailed change narratives with color-coded icons
- Legacy format fallback for entries created before the narrative system
- Maximum 500 entries per query

**Files:** `api/server.js` (logAudit, describeStateChanges, buildNarratives, findMovedItem), `audit.html` (DiffDetails component)

### 14. Auto-Seeding

The Growth vertical is automatically seeded with 63 sample projects if no data exists, providing a realistic demo dataset.

**File:** `api/server.js` (seed section, lines 347-423)

### 15. Undo / Redo

Client-side undo/redo system that captures vertical state snapshots before each user-initiated mutation.

- **Undo stack:** Max 50 entries, stored in a `useRef` (no persistence across reloads)
- **Redo stack:** Cleared whenever a new action is taken
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** Ctrl+Z (undo), Ctrl+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y (redo)
- **UI:** Two buttons (↶ ↷) in the header, disabled when stack is empty
- **Scope:** All state mutations (capacity, tracks, splits, milestones, timeline, buffer, block order) — project edits are NOT included
- **Server sync:** Undo/redo saves immediately to the server (not debounced) and skips pushing to the undo stack itself

**File:** `index.html` (undoStackRef, redoStackRef, setVerticalStatesWithUndo, handleUndo, handleRedo)

### 16. Dashboard / Summary View

A dedicated "Dashboard" tab showing capacity analytics and project distribution metrics computed from existing data.

**Dashboard sections:**
1. **Summary Cards** — Total projects, roadmap count, in-progress count, backlog count
2. **Capacity Utilization** — Per-discipline (Backend, Frontend, Natives, QA) bar charts showing used vs. available capacity with buffer applied
3. **Demand vs Supply** — Total demand (all projects) compared to available capacity, highlighting over/under-capacity per discipline
4. **Per-Track Breakdown** — Table showing each track's used/allocated capacity per discipline with utilization percentage
5. **Projects by Pillar** — Distribution of projects across strategic pillars (Expansion, Acquisition, Comms, etc.)
6. **Projects by Impact** — Bar chart showing project count distribution across impact sizes (XS to XXXL)
7. **Size Map Reference** — Current T-shirt size to story point mapping

All data is computed from existing `useMemo` hooks — no additional API calls needed.

**File:** `index.html` (DashboardView component)

### 17. Scenario Snapshots

Named snapshots that save the full state + projects for a vertical, allowing teams to compare and restore different planning scenarios.

- **Save snapshot:** Captures current state and projects with a name and optional description
- **List snapshots:** Shows saved snapshots with metadata (name, date, creator, project count) — lightweight (no full state/projects in list response)
- **Restore snapshot:** Overwrites current state and projects, broadcasts WebSocket update to all connected clients
- **Delete snapshot:** Removes a snapshot permanently
- **Audit logging:** All snapshot operations (save, restore, delete) are logged

**Storage:** `snapshots_{vertical}.json` — Array of `{ id, name, description, createdAt, createdBy, state, projects }`

**UI:** "📸 Snapshots" button in header → modal dialog with save form and snapshot list

**Files:** `api/server.js` (snapshot endpoints), `index.html` (snapshot modal and handlers)

## Deployment

- **Frontend (Vercel):** Auto-deploys from GitHub on push. Serves `index.html` and `audit.html`.
- **API (Railway):** Auto-deploy webhook is currently broken. Workaround: disconnect and reconnect the GitHub repo in Railway Settings to force a fresh deploy from the latest commit.

**Railway project:** https://railway.com/project/5fefb7ac-b24a-4cb5-899e-341b0de34f3f
